# Create your models here.
# A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data.
# It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re storing.
# Generally, each model maps to a single database table.
# Each model is a Python class that subclasses django.db.models.Model.
# Each attribute of the model represents a database field.
# With all of this, Django gives you an automatically-generated database-access API; see Making queries.

  class Meta(object):
    # this model will be an abstract base class.

    # order object by primary key
    ordering = ('pk', )
  # 2 default field for all object created date and updated date
